# User Journey Analysis: From Registration to First Payment

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the analysis of user behavior from the point of registration to the first payment. The project was created using Tableau, focusing on the visualization of key user journey metrics. The analysis includes the creation of advanced chart types and the application of sophisticated chart settings to present the data in an insightful and professional manner.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:
- To practice creating new types of charts in Tableau.
- To use advanced chart settings effectively.
- To experiment with new Tableau features to solidify newly acquired skills.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project captures the steps taken by users from registration to their first payment. The data provides insights into user conversions at each stage of the funnel, including registration, trial start, and payment completion.

## Dashboard Components

The dashboard is divided into the following components:

### 1. Key Metrics
Three individual blocks representing critical user journey metrics:
- **Number of Registered Users**: The total count of users who completed the registration process.
- **Number of Trial Starters**: The number of users who initiated the trial period.
- **Number of First Payments**: The count of users who made their first payment.

Each of the last two blocks includes tooltips that display the conversion rate from registration to the respective step.

### 2. Registrations and Conversions Over Time
A bar chart combined with a line chart that shows:
- The number of registrations per month.
- The number of conversions from registration to trial in each registration month.

### 3. Average Days from Registration to Payment
A line chart that presents:
- The average number of days taken by users from the registration date to their first payment.
- This is broken down by the month of registration to understand seasonal trends or delays in user behavior.

### 4. User Conversion Funnel
A funnel chart that visualizes the step-by-step journey of users through the following stages:
- **Registration**
- **Email Verification**
- **Profile Completion**
- **Setup Completion**
- **Trial Start**
- **First Payment**

The chart displays both the absolute number of users completing each step and the relative conversion rates, providing a comprehensive view of the user journey.
